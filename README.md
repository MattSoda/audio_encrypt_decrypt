This project is a Python-based application that allows users to record audio, encrypt it using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), and decrypt it back to its original form. The tool incorporates Fourier Transform to convert audio data between the time domain and frequency domain, adding an extra layer of security to the encryption process. The application features a user-friendly GUI built with tkinter, making it easy to use for recording, encrypting, decrypting, and playing audio.
